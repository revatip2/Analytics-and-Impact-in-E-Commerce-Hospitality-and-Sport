## NBA Data Analysis

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze complex datasets to evaluate player performance and provide actionable insights that can influence team strategies and decision-making processes. The analysis combines advanced metrics like True Shooting Percentage (TS%) with traditional metrics (e.g., Points per Game, Assists per Game) to assess the value of NBA players, particularly focusing on those who are potentially undervalued or overvalued.

### Project Overview

This analysis dives into various performance metrics of NBA players, emphasizing the following areas:

- **True Shooting Percentage (TS%)**: This metric is used to gauge the scoring efficiency of players, taking into account field goals, three-point field goals, and free throws. High TS% indicates efficient scoring, while lower TS% may suggest inefficiency.
- **Traditional Metrics Analysis**: The analysis includes traditional basketball statistics such as Points Per Game (PPG), Assists Per Game (APG), Steals Per Game (SPG), and Blocks Per Game (BPG). These metrics are used to provide a more comprehensive view of player performance.
- **Player Valuation**: A comparison of players using both TS% and traditional metrics to identify those who may be undervalued or overvalued.
- **Late-Game Performance**: This section highlights the players who excel in crucial moments, analyzing their performance in the final quarter and overtime during the 2019-2020 NBA season.

### Key Insights

- **True Shooting Percentage (TS%)**:
  - **High TS% Players**: Daryl Macon and Zach Norvell Jr. stand out as highly efficient scorers, suggesting they might be undervalued based on traditional metrics.
  - **Low TS% Players**: Players like Amile Jefferson and Moses Brown have lower TS%, which, combined with their traditional metrics, could indicate overvaluation or accurate valuation.
- **Traditional Metrics Analysis**:
  - **Undervalued Players**: Trae Young and James Harden display high TS% and significant contributions across traditional metrics, suggesting potential undervaluation.
  - **Overvalued Players**: Antonius Cleveland and Matt Mooney, with lower TS% and traditional metrics, might be considered overvalued.
- **Late-Game Performance**:
  - **Clutch Performers**: LeBron James, James Harden, and Donovan Mitchell lead in scoring during late-game situations, emphasizing their importance in critical moments.
  - **Pressure Performers**: Players like Tyler Cook and Kyle Guy are noted for their contributions that occur solely during late-game situations, making them valuable assets in tight games.

### Business Impact

The insights derived from this analysis can significantly impact team strategies and player evaluations:

- **Player Acquisition**: Teams could focus on acquiring undervalued players with high TS% and consistent performance in traditional metrics, ensuring cost-effective team building.
- **Game Strategy**: Coaches can leverage the late-game performance analysis to identify clutch players, ensuring they are utilized in critical moments of the game.
- **Player Development**: The analysis provides a framework for evaluating and improving player efficiency, guiding training and development programs.

## UCI E-Commerce Customer Segmentation and Cluster Analysis

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze customer purchasing behavior and sales data to derive actionable insights that can drive business growth. Through detailed customer segmentation and identification of seasonal sales patterns, I provide strategies to enhance marketing efforts and inventory management.

### Project Overview

This analysis is based on UCI sales data and focuses on understanding customer behavior and sales trends. The key areas of focus are:

- **Monthly Sales Trends**: The analysis identifies potential seasonal patterns in customer purchasing behavior, highlighting peaks in sales that may correspond to holidays or promotional periods (e.g., Black Friday). Understanding these trends helps in planning inventory, marketing campaigns, and sales strategies to capitalize on periods of high demand.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Customers are segmented based on their purchasing behavior, specifically looking at total revenue per customer and the number of orders per customer. This segmentation helps in identifying different customer types, such as high-value customers, frequent shoppers, and those who may need additional engagement to boost their purchasing activity.
- **Cluster Analysis**: The analysis clusters customers based on their spending and ordering frequency. The average total spending and average number of orders for each cluster are calculated to observe distinct purchasing behaviors.

### Key Insights

- **Monthly Sales Trends**:
  - The analysis of monthly sales data reveals potential seasonal patterns, with peaks likely due to holidays or seasonal promotions like Black Friday. These insights can guide inventory planning and the timing of marketing campaigns to maximize revenue.
- **Customer Segmentation and Cluster Analysis**:
  - **Cluster 0**: Moderate spenders with frequent orders. These regular customers exhibit consistent purchasing behavior.
  - **Cluster 1**: High-value customers with high spending and a significant number of orders. These customers are prime targets for premium offers and loyalty programs.
  - **Cluster 2**: Low spenders with fewer orders. These occasional shoppers may include new customers who have not yet fully engaged with the platform, suggesting a need for engagement strategies.
  - **Cluster 3**: Frequent shoppers with high spending. These customers are crucial to the business due to their consistent high spending and should be prioritized for loyalty programs and personalized promotions.
- **Product Preferences by Cluster**:
  - Each customer cluster has distinct product preferences, providing insights into their interests. These preferences can be leveraged for targeted marketing, ensuring that promotional offers are tailored to the specific interests of each cluster.
